The Crop Recommendation System project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to predict the most suitable crops for farmers based on various environmental and soil factors. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, leading to increased yields and improved agricultural practices.
The main components which descides the crops are:
1.Nitrogen
2.Potassium
3.Phosphorus
4.Humidity
5.Temperature
We have to provide the input on the above factors and then our recommendatiion system will provide us the proper crop in the suitable environment
